      much do whatever you want with it. If you in a class, please remember to

        <!-- a stands for 'anchor', which doesn't really make very much sense... The <a> element is used to

      The de-facto site for information on web technologies (in my opinion, at
      least). In addition to having expansive documentation and examples, it
      also has number of informative tutorials and exercises for programming.
      There are also a number of useful statistics for web developers, like what
      browsers are most popular.
